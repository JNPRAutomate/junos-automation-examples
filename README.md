This project is a repository developed by the Juniper community. Some "automation" does not require a script, so there is no requirement for automation examples to have a script in their individual directories. 

Other helpful repositories include the [scriptorium](https://github.com/Juniper/junoscriptorium) and [junosautomation](https://github.com/Juniper/junosautomation).
