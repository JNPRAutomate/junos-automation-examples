Description: Minimal building block script to show how to do a banner.  [Banners are configurable in the CLI](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/user-access/topics/topic-map/junos-os-login-settings.html#id-configuring-junos-os-to-display-a-system-login-announcement), but some people may want to add more features to their banners.  This is a starting point for those people.
